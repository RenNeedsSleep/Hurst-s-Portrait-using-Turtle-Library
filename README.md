# Hurst-s-Portrait-using-Turtle-Library

Damien Hirst is a well known for his spot paintings which are minimalist in their aesthetic, the spot paintings can be replicated in various colors, many times over. Hence i have used turtle to extract colors and make a million dollar portrait myself.

##**ðŸš€ How It Works**

The program sets up a grid of dots (10 Ã— 10).
Each dotâ€™s color is randomly chosen from a predefined color list.
The result is a digital version of Hirstâ€™s art, made with Python code.

##**ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project**

hurst.jpeg â†’ Reference image used to extract colors.
Hurst.py â†’ The Python script that generates the painting.

##**ðŸ–¥ Running the Program**

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

##**Run the script**

```python Hurst.py```

A turtle graphics window will open and start drawing the painting.
Click on the screen when youâ€™re done to close it.

##**ðŸŽ¨ Features**

Uses a custom color palette extracted from the painting.

Creates a 10Ã—10 grid of colored dots.

Each run produces a slightly different artwork because the dotsâ€™ colors are randomized.
